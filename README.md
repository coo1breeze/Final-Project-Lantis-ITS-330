# Final-Project-Lantis-ITS-330
The final project for the ITS330 class I took. Written in C.

The folder contains my submission for the final (The professor doesn't work there anymore, so there's no harm in uploading this stuff)



Here's an excerpt of the instructions from the pdf you'll find in the main section of this repo:

"Write a C program using the template from Blackboard that will calculate the paycheck for the employees in theemployees struct found in the "payrolldata.h" file.  It should have arrays made out of structs for federal marriedtaxes, federal state taxes, federal exemptions, and state exemptions.   NOTE: The federal married tax table andsingle tax table are the same structure.  You should only make one struct that will be used for both of them.  Thesame goes for federal and state exemption allowances.  When searching the tables, if a value is not found in thetable, the data from the last row should be returned."
